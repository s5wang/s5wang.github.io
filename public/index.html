    <p>My current research is centred around various formal systems of intuitionistic logic, including arithmetic and set theories. My work involves studying proof-theoretic interpretations such as cut-elimination results and realisability models to determine the consistency strength and other properties of said theories.</p>
    <p>I have a broad interest in different approaches of dealing with a formal language, such as traditional proof theory, higher recursion theory, type theory and computer-assisted proof verification.</p>
